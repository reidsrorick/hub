    <h1>Spicy UNO Rules</h1>
    <h2>Base UNO Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player starts with 7 cards.</li>
      <li>Match cards by color or number to discard.</li>
      <li>Special Cards:
        <ul>
          <li>Skip: Next player skips their turn.</li>
          <li>Reverse: Play direction changes.</li>
          <li>Draw Two: Next player draws 2 cards and skips their turn.</li>
          <li>Wild: Change the color to any color.</li>
          <li>Wild Draw Four: Change color and next player draws 4 cards</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Say "UNO" when you have one card left. First player to discard all cards wins.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If another player notices you have one card left and you forgot to say "UNO", they may call you out by saying "UNO" before you. You must draw 2 cards as a penalty.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone may start the game by playing a valid card on top of the starting card from the draw pile.</li>
      <li>Once the first card is placed, play continues clockwise from that player.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Spicy UNO Additions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jump-Ins:</strong> If you have an exact match (same color and number) as the top card, you may play it out of turn, skipping players ahead of you.</li>
      <li><strong>Stacking:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>+2 cards can be stacked by <strong>any player</strong>, even out of turn. Each stack increases the draw total for the next player.</li>
          <li>+4 cards may be placed on top of +2 cards, but +2 cards may not be placed on top of +4s.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Number-Specific Spicy Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 - Rotate Hands:</strong> Everyone passes their hand in the direction of play.</li>
      <li><strong>1 - Trade Hands:</strong> Trade hands with any player. Play pauses until you decide. You may choose not to trade.</li>
      <li><strong>6 - Table Slap:</strong> Everyone slaps the table. Last to slap draws 1 card.</li>
      <li><strong>7 - No Talking:</strong> <strong>No one</strong> is allowed to talk until <strong>another 7 is played</strong>. Anytime a player talks, <strong>that player</strong> draws 1 card.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Silent UNO Rule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If <strong>No Talking</strong> is in effect (after a 7 is played), you must <strong>raise your index finger</strong> instead of saying "UNO".</li>
      <li>If you say "UNO" out loud while silence is in effect, you must <strong>draw 1 card</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If You Have No Card to Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Option 1 - Draw Until You Can Play:</strong> You must draw from the draw pile until you draw a playable card.</li>
      <li><strong>Option 2 - Ask for Help:</strong> You may ask another player for a card. 
        <ul>
          <li>They <strong>cannot</strong> show you the card before you accept it. If they do so, you are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to accept the card.</li>
          <li>Once the card is in your possession (even if you haven't looked at it), you must take it and add it to your hand.</li>
          <li>Players <strong>ARE</strong> allowed to lie about the card they give you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
